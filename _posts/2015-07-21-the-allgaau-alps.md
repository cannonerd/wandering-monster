# The Allgäau alps

For a glorious and brutally hot 4 days our company packed itself to a plane, flew to Allgäau to stay at hotel Prinz-Luitpold-Bad, a luxurious four star wellness hotel in the Allgäau alps. The idea behind the trip was to relax, do some hiking and enjoy good food.

The view from my room was gorgeous, as it always tends to be when staying at the Alps.

We started the weekend with some well earned relaxation. Sauna, pool, sunshine and a bit of weißweinschorle do wonders for a human being.

Our firs trip was to hike up to Traualpsee from Vilsalpsee. Elevation on the days hike was 500 meters. The day was brutally hot and the added wight on the head of the previous days relaxation did not help at all. Luckily we were packed with a lot of water and found some streams to cool our heads in.

At our destination of the day at Traualpsee we stopped in a small hutte. Luckily for us, they were open and served light snacks and beer.

After the days walk, it was nice to pop into the freezing water of Vilsalpsee.

On the next day we started at 3.30 in the morning to be able to greet the sun at the top of Omach.

Amin was awesome enough to bring us some sparkling wine as a supprise. Going down a mountain while slightly tipsy is quite an experience I can tell you!

The view was absolutely breathtaking. The top of Omach was also the place where wore my montbell jacket for the first time. It was the perfect thing to put on as we had to wait for the sun for an hour or so (we were faster on our way up than we expected).

On the way down as the sun was rising also the cows were waking up. Mostly they just ate, but one of them was especially curious of us. This one tried to eat my pants.

And this one really went for the cuddles.

All of my stuff packed into a GR0\. It was a snug fit, but I made it! I had just the perfect gear and I felt that nothing was missing. Full packing list at [Lighterpack][0].
