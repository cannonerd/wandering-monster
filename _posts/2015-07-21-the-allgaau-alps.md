# The Allgäau alps

For a glorious and brutally hot 4 days our company packed itself to a plane, flew to Allgäau to stay at hotel Prinz-Luitpold-Bad, a luxurious four star wellness hotel in the Allgäau alps. The idea behind the trip was to relax, do some hiking and enjoy good food. 

The view from my room was gorgeous, as it always tends to be when staying at the Alps.

Traualpsee was our highest point for the hike. There was a small cabin and they served beer and light snacks for the tired hikers.

On the way up to Traualpsee from Vilsalpsee. Elevation on the days hike was 500 meters.

Vilsalpsee was breathtaking. After the days walk, it was nice to pop into the freezing water.

a bit of relaxation is in order before 2 days of upp and down a mountain.
