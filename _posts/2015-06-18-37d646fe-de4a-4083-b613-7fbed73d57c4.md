# The Binz experience

A weekend trip to Binz with friends.

We stayed in a small holiday home not far from the mains street at waters edge. On the firs evening we played some ingress, ate well and did some sightseeing on the pier.

The end of our dinner was timed perfectly as we stepped outside and saw the fireworks. A grand beginning for the weekend

We embarked on a small train ride to see the different sides to Binz. [The Rasender Roland][0] is a steam train that runs on a narrow track through the island.

On Sunday we drove up to Kap Arcona and climed up to the lighthouse.
