Finland was the destination for the first trip with my new Goruck GR0 backpack.  21 liters of space, which I extended a bit with a plastic bag attached to the MOLLE webbing outside the bag as I had to acquire some unplanned additions to my travel set (namely a dress and shoes to fit a fine wedding party).

The backpack proved to be a good fit for me. The GR0 is comfortable to carry. The weight of the backpack is evenly distributed to my shoulders and the backpack sits on its position and does not shift around leaving a secure feeling for exploring the city with the backpack. The back panel is nearly straight and does not leave much room for ventilation, so it will make your back sweaty in no time. A small annoyance that I can (and need to) live with. 

The size restriction of the backpack means also a weight restriction. The backpack is reasonably light to carry around for the whole day, even with the camel pack full. This lightness reduces the need to try and find luggage storage to zero. On my travels I seldom have a plan for the overnighting, so having the painless carryability is crucial for me. This time it ment that every night I was sleeping somewhere else. It's a bliss to have a lot of good friends.

I equipped my GR0 with a camelpack. It immediately found it's place as a core ingredient of my future backpacking experiences. I tend to go thirsty fairly easily and when thirsty I also get annoyed more or less about everything in no time. So having a source of water with me will make me a more pleasant person to travel with in the future. Yay for everyone!
