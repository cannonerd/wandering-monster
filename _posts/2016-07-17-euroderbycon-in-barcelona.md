Euroderbycon was an amazing experience. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2c33add6-10eb-4b8b-b79d-7e3aac7ad2a7.jpg)

The amount of sweat poured to the training track was huge and now that it is all over and all my muscles hurt like hell I can only recommend this to all the derby people. 

Between the trainings i took a bit of time off to look at some sights of Barcelona.
