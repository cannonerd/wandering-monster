# Packing for an adventure

To travel is to see places. To be able not just to travel, but to go on an adventure requires the ability to decide on a moments notice to go. 

To do this, I need to have a solid plan for the items I pack with me and to have a solid plan, I need to think what qualities are the most important in the gear I use in my everyday life. Traveling should not be an exception, it should be your life with your stuff in a different location.  

Thinking of traveling just as my life somewhere else has led to an rather extreme minimization of my life at my home. I have 5 shirts and 5 tanktops left, I don't need more and for traveling I pack 3 sets with me and do laundry when needed. Now that the difference between what I have at home and what I pack with me is practically non existent, I have less stress in the packing process. The same gear at home and while traveling means that everything is proven to be useful in many times over.

So, what have I got left then. I have a shell jacket Fjällräven Stina as the outer layer and for spring/fall. For making it warmer for the winter I have a Montbell Plasma 1000 down jacket. As shirts I have Icebreakers Siren tank and Everyday longsleeve, as underwear I have Icebreakers Hipkini Botanical and various models from Change and Kymen Sukka. Pants are my biggest trouble at the moment and my grand plan is to travel to Beijing again and have custom made pants from a luxurious blend of silk and wool. On top of this, I have few cotton dresses that I have made myself and a kilt and few jean skirts. I have also few hoodies, but those don't usually travel with me, as they take far too much space. Shoes are my second trouble choice. I haven't found a good solution for show. How to have shoes for all climates and shoes that go with dresses and pants and don't take too much space?

My ultimate traveling set is still an ongoing process, which I don't think will ever be finished.
