# x-mas in Finland

10 days in Finland meeting friends and family. Helsinki was beautiful and gloomy. Luckily for the last 2 days we actually got to experience a bit of winter (which I have dearly missed) when a few centimeters of snow and a brutally icy wind hit Helsinki.  
Goruck was packed to the extremes, when also the gifts that I got needed to be packed in.   
Observations on clothing led to me adding a pair of 260 g/m leggings to my shopping list and buying a Särmä merino hoodie for my travels. Now I should be warm in any given weather. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5d9c24a1-dbe6-431c-a960-6dbca05c56d0.jpg)

As a part of the trip we drove up to Central Finland. The ice cover for the lake was just forming up and we used that chance to go for a small rowing trip.
