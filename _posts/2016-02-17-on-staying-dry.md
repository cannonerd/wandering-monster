# On staying dry

Rain, the ever present companion of trips. The problem that needs to be adressed is how to protect yourself from rain. Though I usually opt in to just have a single solution to a problem, with rain I have chosen to address staying dry with a dual solution; umbrella for city trips and rain jacket for more outdoorsy trips.

The reasoning behind the dual solution is the different characteristics of the environments. In city landscape I mostly need to protect myself only for relatively short periods at the time. For that an umbrella is a easy to use and quick to deploy solution. For hiking the problem is different. Then the probable situation is that I need to stay in the rain for whole of the day, so I want to have free hands and good rain cover, ergo rain jacket.

On umbrellas I made quite a bit of research which basically lead nowhere. Yes, there was a few brands that featured in many blog posts, but the availability of those brands in Europe was nonexistent. And living in Germany and the hassle of needing to actually go to Zollamt on some of the cases really discourages you from shopping outside the EU area.

I ended up choosing a local brand,[EuroSchirm][0], the model I chose was [Light Trek][1]. I could have chosen a model that is lighter and smaller, but I didn't. I have the space and I can carry the weight. Fewer hinges gives out fewer places where the umbrella can break. The previous umbrella I had in this size held up for 6 years (did not carry it with me every day), I hope this one will do as much at least.

Regarding the rain jacket, I was sold when I saw how small the rain jacket Houdini from Patagonia goes! My friend had one in his backpack and pulled it out when there was a slight drizzle. Amazing. It slightly larger than my fist and what came out seemed like a nice small rain jacket. Tried it (it was mens Houdini) and came to the conclusion that I definately need the womens version. My butt did not fit in, although otherwise the jacket was of a good fit. Tried to buy it immediately only to find out that the womens models come in horrific shades of pastels. Nope, nope, nope.
