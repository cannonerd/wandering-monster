Thus far I, the wandering monster, have travelled far and wide without much of a thought. It all changed on one trip where not thinking led to overpacking. Since then going for a trip has also been an exploration to what to pack and how to do it.

At the moment my trusted companion for my trips is a GR0 backpack. It offers me just enough space, so I can live my life away from home with everything I need without being too heavy.
