# Gear

Where am I travelling? What should I pack? The age old questions of packing and even more so when trying to pack lightly. I keep track of my luggage on my travels with the help of [lighterpack.com][0]. Lighterpack gives be the ability to track the gear I had while traveling. It serves as a history and a planning tool. I created a list called [Universal 2015][1], which I use as a basis for my other packing lists. With the universal list I just need to add few rare items and mostly just remove the unnecessary ones from the packing list. 

The basis for my packing is my GR0 backpack. With 21 liters of space I really need to be on top of my game when planning what to take with me and what to leave behind. Thus far, it has been working really nice.
