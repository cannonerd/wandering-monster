Moving the desk from Berlin to Leeds for a week.

A change of scenery from time to time is an excellent way to boost up productivity. Breaking the routines from home and letting the inspiration guide you in a fresh environment boosts my productivity a lot.   
Rainy Leeds created the backdrop for the week. The office was a plain conference room where we packed ourselves into random seats.  
Royal Armories museum was a wonderful place to visit for a history geek like me. Cannons! Swords! Epicness! (and exhaustion if one has a icky sticky flu)

A staircase to dream of..

The various dinner places were sometimes hard to find as everything in Leeds during x-mas shopping time seems to be fully booked. In few of the places we got to enjoy the holiday spirits with crackers and silly hats.

My favourite part of this location was the Liverpool-Leeds Canal that was on my way from the hotel to the office. Passing the few houseboats on their winter moorings jolted the conversation towards the good qualities of houseboats and what are the must-have features in one.

Planning the next steps happened usually in the evening s over a pint or two. The beer (other than lager) desolation of Berlin was broken up nicely.

But not forgetting the good things from Berlin either. Gl√ºhwein season had also opened in Leeds. The German x-mas market was in town and we paid a visit.

As usual, I packed along my GR0\. The packing list can be found at [lighterpack.com][0]
