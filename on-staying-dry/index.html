The previous umbrella I had in this size held up for 6 years (did not carry it with me every day), I hope this one will do as much at least.</p><p>Regarding the rain jacket, I was sold when I saw how small the rain jacket Houdini from Patagonia goes! My friend had one in his backpack and pulled it out when there was a slight drizzle. Amazing. It slightly larger than my fist and what came out seemed like a nice small rain jacket. Tried it (it was mens Houdini) and came to the conclusion that I definately need the womens version. My butt did not fit in, although otherwise the jacket was of a good fit. Tried to buy it immediately only to find out that the womens models come in horrific shades of pastels. Nope, nope, nope. I will not look like a merry village idiot. So, I shall be waiting if Patagonia in their great wisdom will release the womens houdini in black, or find a replacement for it.</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="22"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="24"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="25"><span data-reactid="26"><!-- react-empty: 27 --><h2 data-reactid="28"><a data-reactid="29">On staying dry</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="30"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="32"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="33"></div></section></div></div>
