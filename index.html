Helsinki was beautiful and gloomy. Luckily for the last 2 days we actually got to experience a bit of winter (which I have dearly missed) when a few centimeters of snow and a brutally icy wind hit Helsinki. Goruck was packed to the extremes, when also the gifts that I got needed to be packed in.  Observations on clothing led to me adding a pair of 260 g/m leggings to my shopping list and buying a Särmä merino hoodie for my travels.
